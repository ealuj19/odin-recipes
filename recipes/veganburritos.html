        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in diced tomatoes with chile peppers. 
                    Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 
                    about 50 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While rice is cooking, mix cumin, turmeric, basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and seasoned salt 
                    together in a large bowl. Add olive oil. Toss potatoes in the mixture until well coated. Lay 
                    potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat black beans in a saucepan over medium-low heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep warm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, heat tortillas in a separate skillet over low heat until warm, 1 to 2 minutes, or 
                    according to package instructions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lay out tortillas and fill as desired with cooked rice, beans, potatoes, pepper-onion mixture, 
                    spinach, romaine lettuce, and salsa as desired. Wrap up into burritos and serve.
