        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse hibiscus very well to make sure all dust is removed. Place clean hibiscus in a pot over 
                    medium heat, cover with water, and boil for 10 minutes. Remove hibiscus from heat and allow to 
                    steep for at least 2 hours, until hibiscus is very soft. Drain well.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook 1 onion and 2 cloves garlic until soft 
                    and translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in drained hibiscus and season with salt and pepper. 
                    Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until hibiscus turns a deep red color.</li>
                <li>Combine tomatillos, avocado, 1/4 onion, serrano peppers, 1 clove garlic, and 2 tablespoons 
                    cilantro; blend until smooth. Season salsa verde with salt.</li>
                <li>Warm corn tortillas in a skillet. Divide hibiscus mixture amongst tortillas and top with 
                    pineapple, onion, and cilantro. Serve with salsa verde and lime.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
