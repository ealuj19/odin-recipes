# odin-recipes
The goal of the current project is to build a recipe website that contains
a main index page with links to a few recipe pages. Completing the project
will show a basic understading of HTML, with knowledge of how to incorporate
text- paragraphs, bolding, italics/emphasis-, headings, links, and images.
